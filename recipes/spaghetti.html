        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti is the quintessential Italian pasta. It is long – like a string (hence the name, as spago means string) –
             round in cross-section and made from durum wheat semolina. This is the best known pasta shape in the world, so much so that the name is identical in nearly every language.</p>
        <p>These long, round strands are the most popular type of pasta in the United States. Spaghetti means "little twine," and variations include spaghettini (thinner), spaghettoni (thicker), bucatini (thicker and straw-like, with a hollow center), capellini (very thin) and angel's hair (thinnest).</p>
